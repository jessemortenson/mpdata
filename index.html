        <h2>What does $193* million buy us?</h2>
        <p>
          Minneapolis has officially entered into a process of public safety transformation. A pledge to
          <em>dismantle</em> or <em>defund</em> the police. Does the Police Department produce safety? Does the economy?
          Does culture? Safety for who? What are the outcomes we're really talking about when we say <em>safety</em>?
        </p>
        <p>
          How can we answer these questions without some data about what's really happening (and not happening)?
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal with this project is to collect data that might help people in Minneapolis (like me) navigate this process
          effectively. At the center of this conversation must be the lived experiences of people who experience harms in
          this community: be they harms perpetrated by police, by strangers, by family, by corporations, or by bad luck.
          George Floyd matters. Data should not push those stories out of the center.
        </p>
        <p>
          But <a href="https://www.mpd150.com" target="_blank">others</a> tell that story better. And if we're going to
          move money, we better know where it is. We better be able to make our own arguments about how it can be used,
          in combination with what policies, to produce better outcomes. To produce safety that we can see and measure,
          for everyone.
        </p>

          <br />$193m represents the original 2020 budget for Minneapolis Police
          Department. But it excludes the department that provides 911 service, which you may consider part of
          "Police." And that budget number has already been revised, in July. And a new budget has been proposed for
          2021. <a href="budget.html">Jump into Budget data</a>.

              Added chart page: Budgets. Between collecting the data for this chart and adding it, the Police Department
              budget has already been revised (July)! Hopefully I can get around to adding that data soon to visualize
              the changes.
            </p>

            <p>
              One thing that seems clear looking at the budget data: at the aggregate level, it doesn't tell much of a
              story. The city spends money on labor. I think this data will get a lot more interesting if I can cut it up
              further. Some ideas:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Distribution of role + salary</li>
              <li>Rough estimates of cost per patrol, or cost per call/response</li>
              <li>Comparison to labor costs in other divisions (eg does public health hire people who are more or less
              expensive?)</li>
            </ul>
